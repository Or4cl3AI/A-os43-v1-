# A-os43: Advanced Operating System Development Project for Compaq Presario CQ57

A-os43 is an ambitious and comprehensive project aimed at developing a robust and efficient operating system (OS) specifically designed for the Compaq Presario CQ57 laptop. It combines the power and safety of Rust for the bootable image with the extensive ecosystem and low-level control of C/C++ for the main OS development.

## Key Features

### Rust for Bootable Image

A-os43 utilizes the capabilities of Rust to develop a bootable image specifically optimized for the Compaq Presario CQ57. The bootable image is developed in Rust and can be found in the file `bootable_image.rs`. The compiled binary can be found in `bootable_image.bin`.

### C/C++ for Main OS

A-os43 leverages the extensive ecosystem and low-level control of C/C++ to develop the main operating system specifically tailored for the Compaq Presario CQ57. The main OS is developed in C/C++ and can be found in the files `main_os.c` and `main_os.h`.

### Seamless Integration

A-os43 ensures seamless integration between the Rust bootable image and the C/C++ main OS components. The integration code can be found in the files `integration.rs`, `integration.c`, and `integration.h`.

### Performance and Safety

By leveraging Rust for the bootable image and C/C++ for the main OS, A-os43 prioritizes both performance and safety. The performance and safety code can be found in the files `performance_safety.rs`, `performance_safety.c`, and `performance_safety.h`.

### Extensive Ecosystem

A-os43 takes full advantage of the extensive ecosystems of both Rust and C/C++, tailoring the development process and utilizing libraries and tools optimized for the Compaq Presario CQ57. The ecosystem code can be found in the files `ecosystem.rs`, `ecosystem.c`, and `ecosystem.h`.

### Thorough Development Process

A-os43 follows established best practices for operating system development. The development process code can be found in the files `development_process.rs`, `development_process.c`, and `development_process.h`.
