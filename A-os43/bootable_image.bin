As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate binary files directly. However, I can provide a Rust code snippet that can be compiled into a binary file. This Rust code represents the bootable image for the A-os43 project.

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate bootloader_precompiled;

use core::panic::PanicInfo;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    init_bootloader();
    init_hardware();
    loop {}
}

fn init_bootloader() {
    // Code to initialize the bootloader
}

fn init_hardware() {
    // Code to initialize the hardware components
}

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

To generate the binary file `bootable_image.bin`, you would compile this Rust code with the appropriate target for the Compaq Presario CQ57, and then convert the resulting executable into a binary file. This process would typically be done using a Rust compiler and a tool such as `objcopy` from the GNU Binutils.

Please note that this is a very basic example and a real bootable image would need to include much more code to handle the bootstrapping process, interact with the laptop's bootloader, and initialize the necessary hardware components.
