Shared Dependencies:

1. **Hardware Specifications**: Both Rust and C/C++ files will need to interact with the same hardware components of the Compaq Presario CQ57. This includes the CPU, memory, storage, and peripheral devices.

2. **Bootloader Interaction**: The Rust bootable image and the C/C++ main OS will both need to interact with the laptop's bootloader. This includes shared function names for bootloader interaction such as `init_bootloader()`, `load_os()`, etc.

3. **Memory Management**: Both Rust and C/C++ files will share memory management functions and variables. This includes function names like `allocate_memory()`, `free_memory()`, etc., and variables related to memory size and allocation.

4. **Process Management**: Shared function names for process management such as `create_process()`, `terminate_process()`, etc., will be used in both Rust and C/C++ files.

5. **Device Drivers**: Both Rust and C/C++ files will need to interact with the same device drivers. This includes shared function names for device interaction such as `init_device()`, `read_device()`, `write_device()`, etc.

6. **File Systems**: Shared function names for file system operations such as `open_file()`, `read_file()`, `write_file()`, etc., will be used in both Rust and C/C++ files.

7. **Shared Libraries**: Both Rust and C/C++ files will utilize shared libraries that are optimized for the Compaq Presario CQ57. This includes library names and their associated functions.

8. **Message Passing Mechanisms**: Shared message names for inter-process communication such as `send_message()`, `receive_message()`, etc., will be used in both Rust and C/C++ files.

9. **Integration Functions**: Shared function names for integration between the Rust bootable image and the C/C++ main OS such as `init_integration()`, `execute_integration()`, etc.

10. **Performance and Safety Functions**: Shared function names for performance optimization and safety checks such as `optimize_performance()`, `check_safety()`, etc.

11. **Development Process Functions**: Shared function names for development process such as `init_development()`, `execute_development()`, etc.
